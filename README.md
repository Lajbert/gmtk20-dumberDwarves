## About

Dumber Dwarves is a dungeon crawler where you can’t control the adventurers directly and they are not the sharpest tool in the shed. Slap them or throw some meat on the battlefield to give your “instructions”.

The game was created in 48h (well, more like 35h) for the GMTK 2020 game jam. The theme was “Out of Control“.
